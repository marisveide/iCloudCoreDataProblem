var dataStore: DataStore!

var testItem: Item?
var items: [Item]?


// Reproduction of problem described here:
// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36567966/managedobjectcontext-for-nsmanagedobject-becomes-nil-after-restoring-app-from-in
//
// To see the result:
// 0. While logged out of iCloud on Simulator
// 1. Run App
// 2. Read Debug Console
// 3. Press Home button
// 4. Press App icon to restore the app
// 5. See in Debug Console that "- Context: nil"
// 6. Comment the following line in DataStore.swift: self.stack.updateContextWithUbiquitousContentUpdates = true
// 7. Now all Contexts after app restore will be in tact - will not be nil. But App will not get the iCloud updates.
